# express-demo

Simple web back-end written in TypeScript.

The demo will include:

1. [Project setup](/SETUP.md)

2. Basic webserver with Express, with Clean Architecture structure

3. (TODO) Connecting to databases with ORM

4. (TODO) Authorizations

5. (TODO) Other advanced concepts

## The app

This demo app will be a clipboard/text sharing app.

It (will) support basic CRUD operations, as well as authorizations and user groups.

Code is organized following the clean architecture mindset.

The HTTP APIs are not yet stable, so they are not documented.
